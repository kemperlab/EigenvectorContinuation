        - talked to Kemper about design                                                 √
        - need to make HamInit inside HilbertSpace (b/c generalized vectors need init)  √ HamInit is now an inner class
        - overlap matrix, not interaction matrix                                        √ variables named correctly
        - pretty good picture of IO (treat like python library)                         √ understood
        - main() works, as long as vectors aren't lin dep (b_x must not = 0)            √ ok, don't make vectors linearly dependent
        - hard code pbc                                                                 √ pbc is no longer a required parameter
        - soon, do solve_gep                                                (2)         √ check with Kemper that it works. 
        - make hilbert space the argument for EC __init__                               √ easy money. Use case: create hilbert_space with training points and num_qubits; create EC with that hilbert_space and some target points
        - plot just in the module, no need for object                       (3)         √
        - at some point, update UML to have all edits                       (1)         √
        - fix properties so that they have to go through the fancy "gets"   (4)         √
        - update comments                                                   (during ^)  √
        - make num_qubits not in abstract                                               √
        - fix gep in abstract                                                           √
        - fix name of NumpyArraySpace                                                   √

        - vertical line                                                                 √
